## 0.12.0 - Add auto-completion to embedded contexts.
* This makes `atom-polymer` smart enough to not auto-complete whole HTML structures in `<style>` tags, which it did before.
* Now will just auto-complete the *name* of the element, which is handy when writing selectors for long element names.

## 0.11.0 - Add Gold snippets
* Added snippets for all `gold` elements from Polymer.

## 0.10.0 - Format tweaks
* Updates to documentation. Thanks @jreut!
* Fix problem with `paper-icon-button` snippet. (There was an extra quotation mark.)
* Move `<style>` tag inside `<template>` in all snippets. (@jreut)
* Optionally add `bower_components` to default path when importing Polymer in the Polymer Element snippets. (@jreut)
* Add a snippet for Polymer Elements with just style and template. (@jreut)

## 0.9.0 - Whoops
* A glitch in `apm` caused me to accidentally skip this version.
* I tried to publish a new minor version without a token and it incremented the version number before it realized the problem. When I added the token and tried to publish again it bumped the version AGAIN, skipping this one.

## 0.8.1 - CSON escaping issue
